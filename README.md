# Restaurant-Franchisee-Manager--Python-Implementation


There is a chain of restaurant franchise, being managed by a holding company (franchisor). The analytics team at the franchisor company, wants to determine the profit- loss balance sheet of each franchisee joint. Through the exercise, the team wants to narrow down the loss making joints, and suggest solutions to narrow down the loss.  
Write a program to input the Cost Price and Selling Price data of each restaurant. There can be multiple items and quantities for both these data. The Selling Price should also take into account Discount (including successive discounts) and Promos (like "Buy 2, Get 1 Free) before the final analysis. Analyse and determine the cost support to be provided to the restarants which are making less than 10% profits.
Note: 
1. Input "done" after a certain set of data is entered.  
2. For all other inputs, only use numericals as displayed by the legend.
